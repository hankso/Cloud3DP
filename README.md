FAQs
====

Why USB Type-C?
+++++++++++++++
It's **small** and bidirectionally plugable. Bidirection also means up to two working mode(Debug/Upload) corresponding to two plugging direction.

Why IO expander?
++++++++++++++++
ESP32 has huge calculation resources yet much less GPIO (30 pins) comparing to AVR Atmega128 (53 pins).

In this project, ``74*595`` is used to control 6 stepper motors with only 3 ESP32 GPIO. ``74*595``'s high speed clock ensures that the maxmuim pulse frequency (about 25MHz/8bit=3MHz, Vcc=4.5V) on each output pin satisfy the need of controlling a stepper motor.

``PCF8574`` is used to handle 8 endstops with only 3 ESP32 GPIO (1 INT + 2 I2C).

How many ways can I transmit GCode?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- WebConsole using WebSocket on WiFi interface
- Bluetooth interface (you may need a BT client software)
- MicroSD Card
- USB Connection + Cura/Printrun/SerialCommander

What stepper drivers can I use?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The drivers carrier on this board supports AT2100/A4988/DRV8825/TCM2209 layout.

How to change step size?
++++++++++++++++++++++++
On most 3D printer board like Ramps and SmoothieBoard, jumpers are used on MSx pins to configure the step size. But considering the fact that most of users will **never** change the step size after initial configuration, it's an **unbearable waste of space** to have so many 0.1"x0.2"x0.4" jumper cap on board. And that's why I recommend using surface mounted 0.1"x0.1" jumper pad. MSx pins have internal 50kÎ© pull-down resisters and the jumpers are all normally closed. So you need a knife to cut traces between two pads to open the connection. Reapply some solder or a 0R resister to reclose jumpers.

TODO
====
- There should be no floating input pins when using multiple-bit logic devices
- Replace 74HC595 with PCF8574 for valves control
- 74HC595: 11-SHCP 12-STCP
- PIN_INT internal PULLUP
