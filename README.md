1. use ``../assets/fs-config.js`` with fontawesome.min.js
2. SVG JS will insert SVGs as child elements BUT with parent's attribute, so if you have events like onclick on parent element, these will also be copied to child, thus calling event listener function twice. In this ocation, explictly reference icon on child element to prevent coping.
3. If `fas`, `fab` or `far` are in the class list while icon name `fa-*` is to be generated or rendered by Vue, you should

This part is for those who want to compile ESP32's firmware from source.

``Makefile`` dependent on environment variable ``ESP_PATH`` - root directory of ESP-IDF and/or arduino-esp32. Here's my

Installation
++++++++++++

`cnpm install` costs about 8 seconds

FAQs
====

Why USB Type-C?
+++++++++++++++
It's **small** and bidirectionally plugable. Bidirection also means up to two working mode(Debug/Upload) corresponding to two plugging direction.

Why IO expander?
++++++++++++++++
ESP32 has huge calculation resources yet much less GPIO (30 pins) comparing to AVR Atmega128 (53 pins).

In this project, ``74*595`` is used to control 6 stepper motors with only 3 ESP32 GPIO. ``74*595``'s high speed clock ensures that the maxmuim pulse frequency (about 25MHz/8bit=3MHz, Vcc=4.5V) on each output pin satisfy the need of controlling a stepper motor.

``PCF8574`` is used to handle 8 endstops with only 3 ESP32 GPIO (1 INT + 2 I2C).

How many ways can I transmit GCode?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- WebConsole using WebSocket on WiFi interface
- Bluetooth interface (you may need a BT client software)
- MicroSD Card
- USB Connection + Cura/Printrun/SerialCommander

What stepper drivers can I use?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The drivers carrier on this board supports AT2100/A4988/DRV8825/TCM2209 layout.

How to change step size?
++++++++++++++++++++++++
On most 3D printer board like Ramps and SmoothieBoard, jumpers are used on MSx pins to configure the step size. But considering the fact that most of users will **never** change the step size after initial configuration, it's an **unbearable waste of space** to have so many 0.1"x0.2"x0.4" jumper cap on board. And that's why I recommend using surface mounted 0.1"x0.1" jumper pad. MSx pins have internal 50kÎ© pull-down resisters and the jumpers are all normally closed. So you need a knife to cut traces between two pads to open the connection. Reapply some solder or a 0R resister to reclose jumpers.
